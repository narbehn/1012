<!--and for question4.js-->

<!--
Cut and paste this code into your virtual machine and modify question4.js
so that rather than copying the contents of the input element to the output
element, instead your program should only copy those letters, in order that
are vowels (that is one of a, e, i, o or u). So for the default value of
input above, the output div should contain ieee upon completion of the function go().
Upload your revised question4.js file to the moodle assignment associated with your lab test.
Only upload the revised file question4.js to the moodle site.
