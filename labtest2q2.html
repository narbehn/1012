<!--
Cut and paste the above code into your virtual box. There are a number of errors in the files you have been provided(question2.html, question2.js). Your task is to debug and correct these errors so that the html page produces the desired ouput. You should not try to rewrite all the code. The goal is to make as few changes as possible.
The html file should not be changed.

The javascript file should

	1) call the function go when the page loads

	2) the function go programatically adds a table inside the div with class "funky"

	3) the table should have 13 rows and 2 columns

	4) the cells of the table should contain a letter of the alphabet, such that all letters from a-z

	are in the table. The first row "a" "b", second row "c" "d" and last row "y" "z".

	5) each cell should have a text colour of either red, green or blue using the pattern

	r g

	b r

	g b

	r g

	....

You must upload question2.js to the moodle assignment associated with your lab test.
